       "'Power plants of JSW Energy, Jaiprakash Associates, Jindal Power, Sembcorp Gayatri and Essar Power are among 16 projects that bid for three-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) with states. The auction for 2,500 mw of PPAs has received bids aggregating 4,077 mw.\\n\\nGiven the good response, government is expecting lower tariffs in the range of Rs 3.50-Rs 4 per unit in the current round of the PPA auction against Rs 4.24 per unit in the first such auction conducted last year.\\n\\nThe participating companies include Meenakshi Energy, DB Power, TRN Energy and RKM Powergen, sources said.\\n\\n“The response to the auction has been good this time as the government altered some of the more stringent rules,” an official in know of the development said.\\n\\nAgainst 2,500 mw PPA bids in the pilot auction round last year, aggregate capacity of 1,900 mw was signed. Selected bidders have recently started supplying the entire capacity.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe auctions were kicked off on January 31 last year. PFC Consulting Limited has been appointed the nodal agency for the bidding, while NHPC is the PPA aggregator. NHPC India will sign three-year agreements for procurement of power with successful bidders and power supply agreement with state distribution companies.\\n\\nThe financial bids will be opened on April 18 and thereafter a reverse e-bidding will be conducted under which power producers will have to lower tariffs in the online process. The tariffs will be linked to inflation, unlike the last round where these were fixed for three years.\\n\\nThe reverse e-bid auction for PPAs is in a different format from the previous auction conducted by the power ministry in April last year. In the previous tenders, the bidders had to match the lowest quoted price to bag contracts.\\n\\nAlso, the bidders will quote capacity charges this time and the scheme assures minimum offtake of 85% of contracted capacity to power plants. In the last round, the fixed cost was kept at 1 paisa per unit with minimum offtake guarantee of 55%.'"
